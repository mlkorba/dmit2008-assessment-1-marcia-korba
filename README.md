# Assignment 1 - Airline Passenger List

This repository serves as my project that lists airline passengers, the project's prerequisites, and includes instructions on how to run and build this project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.17.0 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7 or higher recommended)
  
## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```

2. Install project dependencies using npm:
